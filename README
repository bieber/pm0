PM/0 Project by Robert Bieber and Paul Gatterdam

 Compilation
-------------

The included makefile defaults to the target "all", which will compile all
sections of the project.  Simply running "make" in the project directory will
accomplish this. Specific instructions for building and running the individual
targets are provided below, updated as targets are added

 Virtual Machine
-----------------

Compiling the make target "vm" with the command "make vm" will build the PM/0 
virtual machine, with executable name "vm".  The virtual machine takes as
command line input the filename for the machine code file to run.  It can also
take an optional quiet mode flag, "-q", before the file name.  If the -q flag
is set, the VM will not print any diagnostic information, showing only
output generated by the user's program.  For instance, to run a program stored
at ./tests/testprogram in quiet mode, use the command

   ./vm -q tests/testprogram

while in the project directory.
